                useEffect Hook

    - useEffect is one of the most important and powerful hooks of react.
    - It is used to perfrom some side effects like fetching data, subscribing to events and so on.


    syntax:
    import {useEffect} from 'React;

    function ComponentName(){
        
        useEffect(()=>{}, [dependecies]);

        return(
            <>Component Content</>
        )
    }
        
    - in useEffect() first parameter will be a callback function which gets executed when 
    one of the second parameter that is in dependency array gets changed.
    - dependency array can have state variable/s or it can be empty.
    - when we keep dependecy array empty that useEffect gets only called once that is on 
    component load.
